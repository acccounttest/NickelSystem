**The program cleans your windows folders, files and does it prudely.**

Program can work perpetually or by interruption by the user:
- 1. The manuals operations use different set of rules
- 1. The automatic tasks are made in the background but can too be launched manually.

- 1. Manually:
- Tell a folder can be found.
- Delete a file that exists.
- Empty file content, not the file itself at any moment.
- Erase a folder content , files ,folders or both, not the container.
- Supress a symlink if it is but not source or destination.
- Delete with simple rules, specific folder/size/nb of files/not last(s)/sizes,greater,lesser/exist and contains/date as intuitive/extensions and extraction/name and attributes/.
- Multiple conditions.
- Just open the folder or the file or the symlink.
- Report and status before and after doing anything.
- Can be done in the recycle bin only, if not it is specified.
- Exceptions based on very simple rules combined to restrict the action.
- A rule can decide to escape all exceptions.
- Backup operation to verify it on another machine.

- 1. Automatic:
-Periodic search and alerts only with backup and action.

Made in python 2.7.9 max, precompiled version out of box and all libs separately if you want to build it yourself, normally no libs has changes, just they are not the latest and maybe more difficult and less easily findable.
